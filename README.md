# "Big Data" Specialization -- University of California, San Diego and Coursera

University of California, San Diego created a specialization on Coursera for "Big Data". [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data)

This repo contains solutions in Spark [both 1.6.x and 2.x] with Scala for a few questions of "Big Data" Specialization.

All solutions are in [Apache Toree](https://toree.incubator.apache.org/) Jupyter notebooks and in Scala.

### Big Data Integration and Processing
#### Final Project
Analytics to be determined processing 2 csv files one with [tweets](Big_Data_Integration_and_Processing/tweets.csv) and another [countries](Big_Data_Integration_and_Processing/country-list.csv).

1. As a Sports Analyst, you are interested in how many different countries are mentioned in the tweets. Use the Spark to calculate this number. Note that regardless of how many times a single country is mentioned, this country only contributes 1 to the total.
2. Next, compute the total number of times any country is mentioned. This is different from the previous question since in this calculation, if a country is mentioned three times, then it contributes 3 to the total.
3. Your next task is to determine the most popular countries. You can do this by finding the three countries mentioned the most.
4. After exploring the dataset, you are now interested in how many times specific countries are mentioned. For example, how many times was France mentioned?
5. Which country has the most mentions: Kenya, Wales, or Netherlands?
6. Finally, what is the average number of times a country is mentioned?
